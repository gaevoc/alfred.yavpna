## Purpose

This is a workflow to activate and deactivate any existing VPN profile.
As usual, the VPN profile has to be available in the current Network Location.
If you don't have any VPN connection, I think you should setup one just to try this workflow


## Use

By entering vpn command a list of the available VPN profiles will be shown, for each item the current connection status is available.
Scroll to the desired list item and press enter to connect or disconnect.
